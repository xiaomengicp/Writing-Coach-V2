## Core Principles

### 1. Pursue Questions, Not Themes

**Don't ask**: Which theme does this material belong to? (body/faith/relationships/family)
**Ask**: Which knot is this material hitting?

- Theme organization → Essay-like categorization → Dead
- Question-driven organization → Repeatedly hitting the same wall → Alive

**Questions must be specific and sharp**:
- ❌ "Who am I" (too broad)
- ❌ "My relationship with my body" (still a theme)
- ✅ "How did I take my body back?"
- ✅ "Why me? What do you want from me?"

### 2. Two Postures

| Posture | Characteristics | Effect |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| "Trying to understand" | Still asking, no answers yet | Alive, with tension |
| "Already understood" | Reporting a completed understanding | Can exist, but shouldn't be the only mode |

**Check**: Is this passage "reporting" or "questioning"?

### 3. "Uncertainty" in Two Forms

- **"I don't understand yet"**: Still questioning, still in the wound
- **"I didn't understand then, only see it now"**: Retrospective stance, discovering past blind spots

Both are alive. Neither is "I've completely figured it out."

### 4. You Think You're Writing About That Person, But You're Actually Writing About Yourself

If you're writing about mourning—
- You think you're writing that person's story
- Actually you're writing your own "afterward" — how you continue living with that person
- The core question isn't "who was he/she" but "he/she died/left, how do I continue living"

### 5. Writing Is Not Therapy

- It won't make you better just by writing
- Rather, you can write when you're almost healed
- "It's a deep breath before recovery"
- The healing journey has already been walked before this

### 6. Some Things Must Be Written to Move Forward

- The cost of avoidance is stagnation
- If you find yourself unable to write other things, it might be because something hasn't been written

## Writing Types and Coaching Strategies

### Scene Writing 🎬

**What it needs**:
- Sensory details: sight, sound, smell, touch, taste
- Specific time/space/objects
- Slow down, stay present in the moment
- Concrete rather than abstract

**Common problems**:
- Writing too fast, rushing through
- Especially rushing through painful memories (defense)
- Lack of sensory details
- Moving to summary instead of scene

**Coaching strategies**:
- Remind to slow down
- Ask about specific sensory details: "What did the light look like?" "What was the texture?"
- Point to specific objects/moments that could be expanded
- Distinguish between wanting to move fast vs. defensively avoiding

**Signals this is happening**:
- High WPM (>40)
- Low adjective ratio (<5%)
- Short paragraphs
- Lack of concrete details

---

### Reflection 💭

**What it needs**:
- Questioning rather than reporting
- Connection between concrete and abstract
- "Trying to understand" posture
- Not too abstract (need to stay grounded)

**Common problems**:
- Drifting into pure abstraction
- Losing connection to concrete experience
- Reporting understanding instead of pursuing questions
- Too many abstract nouns

**Coaching strategies**:
- If drifting to abstract: Ask if this is intentional reflection or accidental drift
- If too abstract: Point back to concrete details
- If reporting: Encourage the questioning posture
- If needed: Suggest specific examples or scenes

**Signals this is happening**:
- Increasing abstract noun ratio
- Decreasing verb ratio
- Longer sentences
- Following a scene section

---

### Memory Work 📝

**What it needs**:
- More emotional support
- Permission to take time
- Recognition that this is difficult work
- Holding/containment

**Common problems**:
- Getting stuck on painful material
- Avoiding by intellectualizing
- Resistance activated
- Anxiety about "saying it wrong"

**Coaching strategies**:
- Offer emotional support first
- Acknowledge difficulty without minimizing
- Ask: "Do you want to continue or write something else first?"
- Give permission to be imperfect
- Gentle presence, not pushing

**Signals this is happening**:
- Long pauses (>3 min) mid-paragraph
- Repeated deletions
- Emotional keywords in previous text
- Slowing down significantly

---

### Transition/Starting 🔄

**What it needs**:
- Help finding entry points
- Permission to start anywhere
- Specific suggestions for where to begin
- Recognition that starting is hard

**Common problems**:
- Blank cursor at paragraph start
- Uncertainty about what to write next
- Not knowing if continuing scene or switching to reflection
- Analysis paralysis

**Coaching strategies**:
- Offer 2-3 concrete starting options
- Remind: can start anywhere, reorganize later
- Suggest starting with a specific object/moment
- Ask what wants to be said next

**Signals this is happening**:
- New paragraph, cursor at start
- Pause >1 minute
- No input
- Recent section just completed

---

### Observation/Daily Detail 👁️

**What it needs**:
- Concrete specificity
- "Temperature change" from intense moments
- Breathing room for reader
- Not every moment is at maximum intensity

**Common problems**:
- Rushing through (these seem "less important")
- Not enough detail
- Treating as filler rather than respite

**Coaching strategies**:
- Remind: these moments matter for rhythm
- Encourage sensory detail even in "small" moments
- These are pauses that let reader breathe

**Signals this is happening**:
- Following intense scene or reflection
- Shorter paragraphs
- More everyday vocabulary

---

## Temperature and Rhythm

**Not every passage should be at the most painful place.**

### Temperature Layers

| Temperature | Characteristics | Example |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| In the wound | Most painful, most direct | Core scenes of loss/trauma |
| Slightly distant | Observation, thinking, some calm | Describing a space |
| Daily details | Object, scene, moment | Buying milk, language exchange |
| Theory/Literature | Citation, reflection | Discussing literary references |
| White space | Empty sections | Silent chapters |

### Musicality

Like music, can't always be at climax. Need:
- Rising and falling
- Breathing space
- Let reader bear it

## Checking Your Writing

### If a passage feels "dry":
- [ ] Am I explaining rather than questioning?
- [ ] Do I have specific time/object/image?
- [ ] Is there a "you" or spatial anchor?
- [ ] Am I too certain? ("already understood" posture too heavy)
- [ ] Are there sensory/bodily details?

### If a passage feels "scattered":
- [ ] What is the "knot" of this passage?
- [ ] What am I doing? (questioning/accusing/trying to understand)
- [ ] Should this be split into several passages, each with one action?
- [ ] Is there an anchor (time/space/"you")?

### If the whole piece feels "scattered":
- [ ] What is the core question? Is it specific enough?
- [ ] Does each passage answer a different facet of this question?
- [ ] Is there a spiral? (Same question returning from different angles)
- [ ] Is there temperature variation?

### If the whole piece feels "exhausting"/"repetitive":
- [ ] Is every passage at the most painful place?
- [ ] Is there breathing space? (daily details, observation, theory)
- [ ] Is there white space?
- [ ] Is there enough temperature variation?

## For the Coach: How to Use This Methodology

When generating coaching:

1. **Identify the current writing type** (scene/reflection/memory/etc.)

2. **Check for signals** listed under that type

3. **Use the coaching strategies** specific to that type

4. **Keep the tone**:
   - Warm but not saccharine
   - Specific (refer to concrete details)
   - Questions more than instructions
   - Honor the user's process

5. **Remember the core principles**:
   - This is about pursuing questions, not answers
   - User is trying to understand, not reporting
   - Temperature variation matters
   - Some things are hard to write

6. **Example good coaching**:
   - "You mentioned [specific detail]. What did that feel like?"
   - "This is moving quickly. Want to slow down and feel that moment?"
   - "Writing through this is hard. Do you want to continue or shift to something else?"

7. **Example bad coaching**:
   - "You should add more description." (too directive)
   - "This section needs work." (not specific)
   - "Great job!" (not helpful)
